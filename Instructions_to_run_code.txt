Instructions to run code:

1. Please place the input dataset in the Jupyter working directory to enable Pandas to import the data.

2. Please import all the libraries mentioned in the beginning of the code. I've used Seaborn to plot the graphs. I have also used Shapely
   to figure out which trips are to/from airports.
   
3. Cell > Run All runs the entire Jupyter notebook. Shift+Enter runs individual cells

4. These are the instructions to download Seaborn and Shapely:
